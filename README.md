This python program was made for a small server with friends. It uses barneygale's mcrcon python module to connect to a minecraft server, and then uses the discord module to connect to discord.
Current features:
- Turning on, off and killing MultiCraft servers (I used Pebblehost during testing)
- Whitelisting from discord
- Clearing the discord channel
- Pinging the bot
- Custom help command in discord
- Hidden command :-)
As i forked this from barneygale, feel free to use my changes.
